I want to know how, when and why bacteria use their genes and their products, and ultimately, what makes a successful pathogen.

My main research interests are **Antimicrobial Resistance** and **Host-Pathogen Interactions** of human and animal pathogens.
To sudy those processes, I use different sequencing-based methods (**functional genomics**) to for example understand how bacteria adapt to certain stresses (**gene regulation**) and which genes are important during such conditions (**gene fitness**).

I use microbial functional genomics to study bacterial pathogens, in particular *Klebsiella pneumoniae* and other Enterobacteriaceae species (*Salmonella* Typhimurium, *Enterobacter cloacae*) but also work on *Mycobacterium abscessus* and *Burkholderia cenocepacia*.
